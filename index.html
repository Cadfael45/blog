    <h1>The Blog</h1>
    <a href="/blog/contact.html">Contact </a>
    <p>The purpose of this blog is to present resources for studying a litte bit about data sciene or spredsheet
        modeling.<br>Or, at least, some skills that are useful in one or the other.</p>
    <p>So far, I have prepared a video on spreadsheet modeling and a few on data analytics. </p>
    <p>The spreadsheet modeling example is Sam's Bookstore breakeven analysis.</p>
    <p>As of this writing, no spreadsheet modeling materials have yet been uploaded. So, only the data analytics
        materials are available. More materials, including those on spreadsheet modeling, will be uploaded as they are
        finished.</p>
    <p>The data science video is an introduction to Excel Tables.</p>
    <h2>Videos: Data Analytics Videos</h2>
    <p>Videos on material covered in George Mount's book on data analytics in Excel</p>
