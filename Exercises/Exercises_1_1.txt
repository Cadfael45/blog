Practice Exercises for Data Analytics, Chapter 1  

Exercise DA 1.1  

Open the file 'ch_01.xlsx', used in the video 'DA_C01_main'. Use Excel's Table features to answer the following questions:  
a. What is the total number of rows in the table?  
b. In how many rows is 'fresh' greater or equal to 2000?
c. In how many rows is 'grocery' between 5000 and 8000?  
d. In how many rows is 'frozen' greater than 'grocery'?
e. How many different customer IDs are there? (Hint: Use the 'UNIQUE()' function.)
f. How many different channels and regions are there? (Same hint.)
g. In how many rows is 'frozen' greater than 'grocery'?  
   Hint: You will need to create a new column in the table to answer this question.
         Enter a formula to find the difference between 'frozen' and `grocery` in the first row of the new column. When you enter the formula, Excel will automatically fill in the rest of the column.  
         Then use the Table column filter dialog to count the number of rows where the difference is positive.  
h. (Continuing part g.) How many rows are there where 'frozen' is greater than 'grocery' and 'fresh' is greater than 'milk'?
